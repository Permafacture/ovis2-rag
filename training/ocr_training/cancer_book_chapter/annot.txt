# Cancer of the Testis

## Introduction
Testicular cancers are the most common malignant neoplasm affecting men ages 15 to 35 years. Approximately 90% of testicular cancers are germ cell tumors, which can be broadly classified as seminoma or nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). Male extragonadal germ cell tumors are also discussed in this chapter. Analogous germ cell and sex cord stromal tumors in women are not included here, but in many cases the male and female counterparts share a common biology and therapeutic approach.

## Incidence and Epidemiology
In the United States, 8,820 new cases of testicular cancer per year are estimated for 2014. This figure greatly underestimates the prevalence of testicular cancer survivors. This is because the cancer-specific survival rate for testicular cancer with standard treatment is >95%. The incidence varies among geographic areas, being highest in Scandinavia, Switzerland, and Germany, and lowest in Africa and Asia. Although testicular germ cell tumors are most common among adolescent and young adult men, they can potentially occur in males of any age or genetic background. For reasons that have yet to be discovered, the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors has increased over the preceding 30 years in the United States and United Kingdom.

## Risk Factors
Men whose family history includes a first-degree relative with testicular germ cell tumor or who have a personal history of cryptorchidism are at increased risk of developing germ cell tumor. Testicular cancer survivors are also at increased risk of a second primary cancer in the contralateral testis. These risk factors suggest a genetic or developmental etiology for germ cell tumors. No postnatal environmental risk factors have yet been identified.

## Initial Presentation and Management
### Symptoms and Signs
Testicular swelling is the most common presenting complaint and is detected by the patient himself. Patients may also report a pressure-like sensation, heaviness, or mild-to-moderate testicular pain. This will sometimes be confused with orchitis or epididymitis and treated initially with antibiotics. Acute or severe pain is rarely caused by testicular cancer and suggests a different etiology such as testicular torsion. Testicular ultrasound should be obtained as soon as a neoplasm is suspected, and it will appear as one or more lesions within the testicle. Ultrasound distinguishes a solid from a cystic mass, and intratesticular from extratesticular masses. A solid intratesticular mass on ultrasound is presumed to be a neoplasm and is an indication for transscrotal orchiectomy. Approximately half of patients present with a testicular mass and no clinical evidence of metastasis (clinical stage I). Others present with metastatic disease. Primary testicular tumors can be small and asymptomatic, even in the presence of metastatic disease. Metastatic disease can be the source of clinical symptoms on presentation in such cases, and include back pain, shortness of breath, cough, gynecomastia, hemoptysis, and weight loss. Ultrasound of the testicles is helpful in establishing the diagnosis even there is no palpable testicular mass. The detection of elevated serum tumor markers can also be helpful when an occult testicular primary or extragonadal germ cell tumor is suspected.

## Diagnosis
Radical inguinal orchiectomy is the standard diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for a solid intratesticular mass. Transscrotal orchectomy or biopsy is specifically contraindicated because of the risk of tumor cell seeding of the inguinal and pelvic lymphatic drainage. Biopsy is also of limited value because testicular germ cell tumors are heterogeneous. Removal of the entire organ is necessary to properly site the histologic type(s) present and to select the appropriate therapy. It is reasonable to perform needle biopsy in cases of occult testicular primary, burned-out primary, or extragonadal germ cell tumor; although, the results of needle biopsy must always be interpreted with caution due to sampling error. The pattern of serum tumor marker elevation is also informative about the likely cell types present (seminoma or nonseminoma), as discussed in the next section.

## Histology
Male germ cell tumors are broadly classified as seminoma and NSGCT (Table 70.1). Patients with pure seminoma are managed differently than patients with NSGCT or mixed histology tumors, although mixed tumors may have a component of seminoma. In that sense, when we refer to seminoma as a clinical diagnosis it is meant as pure seminoma, whereas seminoma as a histologic pattern may also be present in mixed NSGCT.

### Seminoma
The microscopic appearance of seminoma is characterized by sheets of neoplastic cells with abundant cytoplasm, round, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 70.1). A prominent lymphocytic infiltrate is common, such that it is sometimes confused with lymphoma until the surface immunophenotype has been determined. Most seminomas do not produce serum tumor markers, but the presence of syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells in a minority of cases accounts for modest elevations of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Seminomas never produce alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and patients whose tumors have the histologic appearance of seminoma and whose serum AFP is elevated should be considered to have a mixed NSGCT, even if a nonseminomatous histologic pattern cannot be identified. Exceptions are cases in which there is another explanation for the elevated AFP, such as liver disease or a chronic nonspecific elevation. Immunohistochemistry is usually positive for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), 1, negative for CD30, AFP, and epithelial membrane antigen, and cytokeratin other negative or weak/focal positive for cytokeratin.

### Nonseminomatous Histologies
Germ cell tumors may be composed of a single histology or multiple histologic patterns. Through poorly understood processes of mutation and differentiation, a single clone beginning as ITGCN can develop into an undifferentiated neoplasm (seminoma), or to a primitive zygotic neoplasm (embryonal carcinoma). Further differentiation of embryonal carcinoma results in somatically differentiated tumors (teratoma) or extraembryonal-differentiated tumors (yolk sac and choriocarcinoma). Nonseminomatous histologies found in germ cell tumors are composed of any histologic cell type other than seminoma or synctiotrophoblastic cells. Male germ cell tumors are thought to derive from malignant transformation of primordial germ cells or gonocytes during fetal development. Primordial germ cells migrate from the proximal epiblast (yolk sac) through the hindgut and mesentery to the genital ridge, and become gonocytes. The precise molecular events underlying transformation to ITGCN are not well understood. The most consistent genetic finding in germ cell tumors is a gain of material from chromosome 12p. The majority of NSGCT and seminomas contain 12p, and CD117-positive germ cell tumors are comprised of two fused short arms of chromosome 12. The remaining (12p)-negative germ cell tumors have a gain of sequences in the form of tandem duplications that may be transposed elsewhere in the genome.

### Embryonal Carcinoma
Embryonal carcinoma is the most undifferentiated type of germ cell tumor and is thought to be pluripotent. Cells are characterized by indistinct borders and scanty cytoplasm, which can be arranged in solid sheets or in glandular or tubular structures. On immunohistochemical staining, embryonal carcinoma can be marked by cytokeratin 50, PLAP, AFP, and hCG. Modest elevations of serum AFP and hCG can be seen, and frequently it is the serum LDH concentration that is an important prognostic factor in metastatic embryonal carcinoma.

## Biology
### Mechanism of Germ Cell Transformation
ITGCN is thought to derive from malignant transformation of primordial germ cells or gonocytes during fetal development. Primordial germ cells migrate from the proximal epiblast (yolk sac) through the hindgut and mesentery to the genital ridge, and become gonocytes. The precise molecular events underlying transformation to ITGCN are not well understood. The most consistent genetic finding in germ cell tumors is a gain of material from chromosome 12p. The majority of NSGCT and seminomas contain 12p, and CD117-positive germ cell tumors are comprised of two fused short arms of chromosome 12. The remaining (12p)-negative germ cell tumors have a gain of sequences in the form of tandem duplications that may be transposed elsewhere in the genome.

Gain of 12p sequences has been found in ITGCN, indicating that it is an early event in testicular cancer pathogenesis. The acquisition of 12p is not thought to be the initiating event, however, because on 12p are likely to be important, and there are candidate genes that confer growth advantage (KRAS, NCCND2 [cyclin D2]), and others that establish or maintain the stem cell phenotype (NANOG, DPPA3, GDF3). The exact genes that are critical to this step have not yet been identified.

Seminomas are usually hypotriploid, whereas NSGCT is more aneuploid. Other chromosome regions were found to have nonrandom gains or losses in germ cell tumors with less frequency. Single cell tumors. The most commonly mutated genes are BRAF, KIT, KRAS, NRAS, and TP53. The KIT/kit ligand (KITLG) pathway is the only treatment option for patients with metastatic seminoma.
