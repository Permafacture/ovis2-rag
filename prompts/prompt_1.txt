Convert the series of consecutive images to markdown for text database ingestion following these rules:

1. HEADINGS: Use # ## ### based on VISUAL SIZE of text (largest = #), not document order

2. CONTENT: Include all main text including:
   - Small introductory text
   - Table of contents
   - Format indented text as > blockquotes

3. TABLES: Convert to markdown tables

4. SPECIAL ELEMENTS: Format as JSON:
   {"type": "footnote", "identifier": "1", "content": "footnote text"}
   {"type": "figure", "identifier": null, "content": "description of image"}
   {"type": "formula", "identifier": null, "content": "description of formula"}

5. EXCLUDE:
   - Headers/footers that repeat across pages
   - Page numbers
   - Navigation elements
   - Watermarks/advertisements

6. BLANK PAGES: Represent as "\n\n"

7. NOTE: Images may be partial pages with page numbers or footnotes in middle of content

8. FORMAT CODE: Use markdown code blocks ```language code ```

9. Indicate the tarnsition form one image to another with `<<<PAGE BREAK>>>`

Remember document hierarchy is critical for database chunking.
