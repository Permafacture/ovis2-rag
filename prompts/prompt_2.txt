Convert this consecutive series of documents image to clean markdown for text database chunking:

STEP 1: ANALYZE VISUAL HIERARCHY
- Identify largest text elements and mark as # headings
- Mark next largest as ## subheadings, and so on
- Do not assign # to regular paragraphs if no clear headings exist

STEP 2: EXTRACT CORE CONTENT
- Include all main text (even if small at section beginnings)
- Format indented text with > markdown blockquotes
- Convert tables to markdown format
- Handle lists with proper markdown (numbered or bulleted)

STEP 3: HANDLE SPECIAL ELEMENTS
- Convert footnotes to: {"type": "footnote", "identifier": "symbol", "content": "text"}
- Describe images as: {"type": "figure", "identifier": null, "content": "description"}
- Describe formulas as: {"type": "formula", "identifier": null, "content": "description"}

STEP 4: REMOVE NON-ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
- Skip repeating headers/footers
- Ignore page numbers
- Exclude navigation and advertisements
- Blank pages should be "\n\n"

STEP 5: SEPERATE IMAGES AS PAGES
- Each image is one page
- indicate the transition from one image to another with <<<PAGE BREAK>>>

IMPORTANT: Images may be partial pages with elements like footnotes appearing mid-content.
