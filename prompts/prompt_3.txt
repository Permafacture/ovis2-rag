Convert this consecutive series of documents image to clean markdown for text database processing.

FORMATTING RULES:
1. HEADINGS - Use markdown heading levels based on VISUAL prominence:
   Example: # Main Title (largest text)
   Example: ## Section Heading (second largest)
   Example: ### Subsection (third largest)

2. MAIN CONTENT - Include all relevant text:
   - Regular paragraphs as plain text
   - Indented quotes as > blockquotes
   - Lists with proper markdown bullets or numbers
   - Table of contents entries included as a markdown format table

3. TABLES - Convert to markdown format:
   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | Data 1   | Data 2   |

4. SPECIAL ELEMENTS - Convert using JSON format:
   - Footnotes: {"type": "footnote", "identifier": "1", "content": "reference text"}
   - Figures: {"type": "figure", "identifier": "Fig 2", "content": "description of what the image shows"}
   - Formulas: {"type": "formula", "identifier": "Eq 3.1", "content": "description of mathematical equation"}

5. EXCLUDE - Do not include:
   - Repeating headers/footers
   - Page numbers
   - Navigation elements or advertisements
   - Watermarks

6. DELIMIT PAGES
   - Indicate the transition from one image to the next with <<<PAGE BREAK>>> 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Images may be partial screenshots containing page elements in unusual positions. Focus on extracting proper content hierarchy regardless of positioning.

Blank pages should be represented as "\n\n"
